## Summary ##
   Totem allows a user to efficiently organize and take advantage of the full music festival schedule. The application allows users to create groups of your friends who are with you at the festival and keep track of where they are on the festival grounds. By coordinating a meetup location, less time is spent on planning, and more time is spent on experiencing the festival.

## Problem ##
  Music festivals can often be an overwhelming experience with the sheer number of people in attendance and the large area that the festival occupies. This problem is exaggerated when it is the users first time at a new festival.

## Solution ##
  Totem gives you the ability to see the location of all of your friends at a music festival and your relative location to the stages and facilities the festival provides. By streamlining the process of planning your group's schedule of several days of concerts, more time is allowed for the user to maximize their time experience the music.
